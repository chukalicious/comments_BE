# CRUD Backend with Postgres setup
### Includes Basic CRUD Methods for an example API

Simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`

## You'll need

- a REST client like [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into its root directory** where you cloned the repo.
- [ ] enter `npm i` to download dependencies
- [ ] enter `npm run` server to start the server
- [ ] create `.env` file and create a variable named `DATABASE_URL=` and give it the value of a postgress database
- [ ] connection line example: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localHost:5434/databaseName`
- [ ] create knex migrations for your data. the `knexfile.js` file has the configurations for the data directories that will be created for the schemas and the seeds, as per knex documentation
- [ ] you can create schemas that would conform to the API endpoints already craeted, or build completely new schemas and endpoints. The code can be gutted completely, it's just a template :smile:
